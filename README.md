# Starbucks-Project
## Installation
* Python 3.7
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn


## Project Motivation
 This the capstone project of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree. The aim of this project is to look at the most important customers of Starbucks.
 The goal is to recognize that a company should focus on the valuable customers instead of every single customer. The group of customers that are responsible of generating 80% of the revenue are very important to be understood and predicted .
 
## File Descriptions
The data is contained in three files:
* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
* profile.json - demographic data for each customer
* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
* Starbucks_Capstone_notebook.ipynb  - The notebook that has all the work

## Results
* There are customers who are not filling the application form carefully.
* Most of these customers are found to be not very active.
* There are no difference between the customers who are responsible for the 80% of the revenue and the others in term of Age and Income.
* The major differences are found in the interactions with the offers.
* Knowing that a group is responsible for most of the revenue doesn't mean they are generating more profit. Information about the profit should be provided first.
